First off, apologies for the delay in releasing the next show. We've had some unexpected issues hosting the podcast so took a sabattical to work out a solution. We've found a suitable partner in [Lib Syn](https://www.libsyn.com/) (recommended by the Triple Dee guys) who know exactly what we want but bear with us while we iron out any teething issues.

With that said,  let's get on with another two hours of uplifting, funky house tunes that's been gracing our ears for the last few weeks.We've got a fantastic collection of new music for you this month from some of our good friends around the house scene.

Ex-Bassmonkey **Danny "Gadgetman" Bond** has sent us his first commercial funky-breakbeat remix of the emerging pop act **PDG v Anniemouse** "_Can't Stop The Boogie_". We wish him luck on his new solo adventure but know, for sure, he's destined for big things.

(Speaking of the **Bassmonkeys**, a little bird tells us they've been working with Finesse sweetheart **Bonnie Bailey** on an amazing new remix due for release soon. We've been promised an advance play on this when it's available so stay tuned for more.)

We've also got an **exclusive** early listen to a remix of **Jidax & Chynna Blue** "_Power Of Love_" by [David Dunne](https://twitter.com/mrdaviddunne) and [Andy Daniels](https://twitter.com/andydaniels), otherwise known as [Triple Dee](https://www.facebook.com/tripledeemusic) (be sure to check out their weekly show/podcast for plenty of funky house and cheeky banter).

Regular label Hed Kandi also have several compilations out at the moment, including the regularly played "Back To Disco" and "Live Sydney 2011". We've selected a couple of our favourite tracks from each including **Jay C & Oliver Lang**'s "_It Doesn't Matter_" and **Jay Santi**'s amazing remix of **Candi Staton**'s "_When You Wake Up Tomorrow_".

**Loleatta Holloway**'s unfortunate passing last month is still close to our heart and we didn't really get to dedicate much to her last time round so this month sees a couple more tracks by the disco queen, including **Hott 22**'s remix of "_Stand Up_" and the banging **Satoshi Tomiie** remix of "_Dreamin'_". Expect more over from the lady over the coming months though - Loleatta is deeply missed, leaving an absolute legacy behind. Rest in peace.
