A new month, a load of new tunes and a regular fixation to fulfil - here is **Episode 44** of the [One Phat DJ Podcast](https://onephatdj.com/podcast), namely "_Apr '08 - The Warm Up_".

## Details

This month sees an influx of new material from WMC Samplers taking over. After an epic week in Miami, with it came a huge backlog of new material to check out and filter out the stuff that you have come to love on the Podcast. I've also included some of my highlights from the latest Fierce Angels release, Fierce Disco II (which I've yet to review, apologies for that). There are some regular "faces" in there such as Moto Blanco and Bassmonkey remixes, as well as the insatiably talented Peyton wrapping up the mix. We also have a (semi) exclusive appearance from an English producer who goes by the name of DJ Ruxpin. Collaborating with the taltented vocalist Scarlet, Ruxpin has created an infectious and corking funky number, full of bouncy basslines and remarkably hooky synth loops. This is an extremely early promo so I'll update you when an official release is due. There's nothing more to say other than "download and enjoy"!
