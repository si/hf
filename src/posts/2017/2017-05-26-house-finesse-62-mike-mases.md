With holiday season officially here, it feels only right to compliment your travels and parties with a few more mixes, carefully selected and supported by your residents.

We start off with a DJ talent from Hertfordshire, **Mike Mases**.

Mike has an impeccable ear for finding the finest disco vibes, new and old, delivering some up-front funky beats, cheeky jams and big drops. We're sure you'll enjoy this hour long mix from his crate of disco delights.
