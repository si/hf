I [hinted a few weeks ago](https://www.simonjobling.com/?p=229) towards some fairly big One Phat DJ news. Well, it is slightly delayed but after getting confirmation this morning, I can finally make the announcement... **One Phat DJ is hitting the radio!** Last month, I was approached by Eugine Pinkerton (also known as Paul Hopwood) of [QMR - "the UK's brightest radio station"](https://www.qmr.fm/) to do a guest mix for his Saturday night show. I'll let [his introduction](https://www.qmr.fm/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=57&Itemid=63) do the talking...

> Playing the best party dance, hip hop & r&b music to carry on that Saturday night feeling, what ever it is your doing, wherever it is you are doing it!

Paul told me he has been a regular listener to the [One Phat DJ podcast](https://feeds.feedburner.com/onephatdj/) for quite a while and had the idea of bringing in guests mixes for the second half of the show. He approached me last month about doing the first guest mix for his show, as well as a ten minute interview to allow the listeners to get to know who One Phat DJ _actually_ is. The interview and mix will be broadcast **live tomorrow night (14th October 2006)** on [QMR's website](https://www.qmr.fm/) from **9pm** through to **12am** (all BST, GMT+1, for those International listeners). For anyone who is planning a night in, I suggest you pop over to the website, load up the live stream (Windows Media Player I'm afraid!) and listen in. If you're not available, I will hopefully be making the mix available for download (with interview) in the next week so you can look forward to that. All that is left to say is if you get to listen to the show, let me know what you think. Let's hope this is the first of many!
