(If only I was!) ![One Phat DJ - Going To Miami cover](images/going_to_miami_cover_300px.jpg) Yet again, its time for me to get my mixing fingers at the ready, delve into my record box and pull out some stonking funky house tracks for an hours worth of mixing. This month, as you may have guessed from the title, is preparing you for the [Miami Winter Music Conference](https://www.wintermusicconference.com/) at the end of the month (24-28th March). It is inevitable that we will hear some of the finest new tunes from some of the biggest artists and DJs from around the globe so I have looked into my crystal ball and hand-picked some of the tunes that you will probably be hearing over the coming months in clubs, bars and, quite even, the summer festivals. True to form I have also gone back in time and chosen a couple of classics from yester-year to finish off the mix with something that I'm sure most of you will be familiar with. [Junior Jack](https://www.juniorjack.biz/)'s **"Stupidisco"** was huge in 2003 so I felt it necessary to take you back a couple of years and throw down his funky sound. You will also get to hear one of my all-time favourites from Degrees Of Motion - "[Shine On](https://www.discogs.com/release/154617)". This song is 12 years old this year but still gets everyone singing along to its anthemic chorus. We had this song played at our wedding party last year so it feels only appropriate to bring it back for [the next big stage of our life](/?p=103).
