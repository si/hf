Last month, [I mentioned I would be filling a guest spot](https://www.simonjobling.com/?p=235) on Internet radio station [QMR](https://www.qmr.fm/). Well it all went to plan and I ended up supplying a special half hour mix in the same vein as the One Phat DJ podcast alongside a ten minute interview with the host DJ _Eugine Pinkerton_. I'm sure there were a few people out there who didn't get to catch the show (it **was** a Saturday night at 11pm!) so, thankfully, Eugine sent me a copy of the show in MP3 format for everyone to download. I won't go into too much detail so just go and [download the show extract](https://www.onephatdj.com/mp3/radio/tastes_like_radio_14.10.2006_interview_edit.mp3) and enjoy One Phat DJ's **first ever** interview alongside some of last month's favourite flavours. Below is a full tracklisting which I am obliged to supply as a [download](https://www.simonjobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/tastes_like_radio_tracklistings.txt "Tastes Like Radio 14.10.2006 Tracklistings") (according to the rules of radio broadcasting).

Let me know what you think. I know there will be a lot of people out there who have never heard the voice of One Phat DJ. There's normally a reason for that but if demand is high enough, I may change the One Phat DJ format in the new year to "_something different_".
