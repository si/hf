The sun is starting to make an appearance. The festivals are commencing. More importantly, good music is getting played wherever you turn. Summer is nearly with us people and that means only one thing - big dance tracks that need mixing together! Your resident DJ **One Phat DJ** has taken it upon himself to bring together some of the biggest tracks you'll hear this Summer and mix them for you beautiful people. ![Vocal Excursion cover](images/vocal_excursion_300px.gif) If that intro hasn't whet your appetite then nothing will. If you are well and truly gasping for your next dose of funky house then look no further - **Vocal Excursion** is here and ready to blast out your speakers and/or earphones. Here's what I've got for your listening pleasure this month...

1. #### Solu Music ft Kimblee - Fade (Grant Nelson Big Room Vocal Mix - Wez Clarke Re-Edit)
    
    This track has been around for what seems an age, appearing on most Hed Kandi releases for at least 2 years. With yet another release due this Summer, Grant Nelson has injected some funky piano and strings into this remix which gets my vote for the Summer. One to watch!
    
2. #### Dennis Christopher - Soulshakin' (Dennis Christopher Club Mix)
    
    A funky little number with some vocals that I recognise - can't put my finger on it though. Any suggestions welcome!
    
3. #### Soul Avengerz - Make My Body Rock (Club Mix)
    
    The [Soul Avengerz](https://www.soulavengerz.com/) have been releasing productions non-stop over the last year or so and this one lives up to their usual high standard. Fewer vocals than the rest of the tracks in this mix but still got an awesome bassline.
    
4. #### Rhianna - S.O.S. (Moto Blanco Vocal Mix)
    
    I can't say I'm a huge fan of this Dance Hall artist but Moto Blanco has done a fine remix of this track that should swing any house music lover into the Carribbean and give in to some commercialism. Good track and worth turning up for a sing-a-long (if you know the words!)
    
5. #### Mark Morrison ft DMX - Innocent Man (Moto Blanco Vocal Mix)
    
    Yet another "Return of the Mack", this time thanks to another remix from the DJ known as Moto Blanco. (Sound familiar?) Some more funky basslines and synth loops make this track worthy of some One Phat DJ airtime.
    
6. #### Candi Williams ft Simpson Horns - I Got The Music In Me
    
    More diva funkiness which has made it on to the Hed Kandi Disco Heaven compilation.
    
7. #### Soul Avengerz - Sing (Bobbly Blanco Mix)
    
    I just can't get enough of these guys. Another fine production from the London boys with what has potential to be a huge Summer anthem. Keep pestering your local DJs for this track when you're out!
    
8. #### C-Mos feat Kathy Brown - Turn Me One Million Ways (Nizzero Whitelabel Mix)
    
    I was sent this awesome white label mashup of C-MOS's cracking instrumental accompanied by the classic vocal talent of Ms Kathy Brown. Come on - you all know the words...
    
9. #### Bob Sinclar ft Steve Edwards - World Hold On (Children Of The Sky) (Club Mix)
    
    Some of you may hate it and others might be getting irritated by the whistling from this French DJ but you can't deny this track is going to be big this year, if not bigger than last year's Love Generation. "World - Hold On!"
    
10. #### DJ Cruze presents The Funkfinders - Cease!
    
    A good DJ friend from Manchester sent me this track last month but I didn't have time to fit it in the mix. This is his first official production but after DJing around the world for over 10 years, he certainly knows what makes a good track and this is a fantastic debut from someone with a good future. [Let him know what you think](https://www.djcruze.co.uk/cms/contact/) (and while you're at it, [check out his podcast](https://www.djcruze.co.uk/cms/podcasts/feed/rss2)!)
    
11. #### Georgie Porgie - Life Goes On (GT-Express Vinyl Soul Mix) _(One Phat Tune)_
    
    This was one of the first records I ever bought back in 1998 and have kept it in my record box ever since. Catchy lyrics from an awesome male vocalist who is still going strong with new releases lately. LOVE IT! [Buy it NOW](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Y1PZ/002-2708413-5820022?camp=2025&dev-t=D3IXYX7ZLO06V1&link%5Fcode=xm2&n=5174)!
    
12. #### Barbara Tucker - Stop Playing With My Mind (Full Intention Mix) _(One Phat Classic)_
    
    One of my all-time favourite songs **ever**! Babs Tucker rekindled her spark last year when she co-wrote one of the biggest tracks of the year "Most Precious Love" with Blaze but this is one of the tracks that launched her career back in the late 90s. Pure class!
    

If you haven't done so yet, go [download Vocal Excursion right now](https://onephatdj.com/mp3/podcast/vocal_excursion_192.mp3) (what are you waiting for?). The podcast should automatically download the lower quality version (96kbps) to speed up the process whereas you can get the high quality 192kbps version [direct from Funky House Tunes](https://onephatdj.com/mp3/podcast/vocal_excursion_192.mp3). As ever, I would love to hear from you. Let me know what you think of the mix, the tracks, where you play it... whatever. It's amazing to think that people from all around the globe are downloading and listening to my mixes every month (its averaging at about **700 downloads a day**!) but thats what house music is all about - the love for good music! Until next month, enjoy the mix. **Update** I've had to move the mixes to a different host due to the high demand. My mixes were demanding **20GB** of traffic **per day** and crippling the host as that was the daily allowance. You shouldn't have any problems accessing the mixes now but if you do, please let me know.
