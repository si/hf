Well hasn't this been a funky month? After [the official podcast](https://www.simonjobling.com/blog/2007/winter-warmup) at the start of the month (which seems to be coming a firm favourite among the regular listeners out there), you were treated to a [special funky number](https://www.simonjobling.com/blog/2007/break-from-the-norm) last week with a bit of a twist to it. It's now time to move on to the third and final treat for December, wrapping up the year just nicely. As a way of a Christmas present from One Phat DJ, let's go out with a bang with a **Christmas Cracker**!

### Description

_Bobby D'Ambrosio_ kicks off the festive proceedings with a remix of the Christmas classic "_O Christmas Tree_", sang beautifully by the lovely _Jamelle Jones_. We then get straight in to the mincemeat of the mix with some full on upbeat vocal treats from our carol singers _Nicole Tyler_, _Vee Scott_ and _Amaya Amaya_. Following the Hed Kandi favourites comes some commercial elves in the form of One Phat Favourite _Georgie Porgie_, lovely _Rihanna_ and the latest phenomena from stateside, _J Holiday_. If that's not enough for you, we get all psyched up with some huge tunes from _Eddie Armani_, _DJ Dervish_ and the rather aptly named _Holy Rollers_. Clubland's favourite _Chanel_ makes a welcome return with her latest offering "_Dance_" to get you up off your arses for a good **boogie** while _Fish & Chips_ drop a cheeky sample from the classic _Spiller_ track "_Groovejet_" into the mix. _Hernandez & Tyo_ treat you to a final big tune full of energy and vocals before we wrap up the whole gift with a remix of _Eartha Kitt_'s "_Santa Baby_" courtesy of our good friend from Manchester [DJ Cruze](https://www.djcruze.co.uk/).
