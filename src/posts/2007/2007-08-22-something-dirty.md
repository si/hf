As promised, I've gone and mixed up a bit of a Summer treat for all the One Phat DJ Podcast listeners. If you like your house music a bit darker, a bit deeper, a bit twisted, _however you want to describe it_, then you are sure to enjoy **Episode 30**. This time, I'm not going to subject you to the verbal diarrhea that is normally attached to a podcast. Just bear in mind the majority of the tracks included are either **new releases** or **exclusive promos** and to respect the artists and producers efforts by purchasing any material you enjoy. There are several tracks from the [Housexy Summer In The City](https://www.ministryofsound.com/music/albums/HousexySummerInTheCity) compilation released earlier in the year (available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000PITXVY/sjmedia-21), [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000PITXVY/sjmedia-21) and [DJ Download](https://www.djdownload.com/click/Th042iwFhCCZE22rNAa/476)) as well as _Fedde Le Grand_'s latest offering which will be getting a full release in the next month or so (definitely his finest work so far in my opinion). Where possible, I have supplied links to the tracks where you can buy them, normally only a few quid (approximately _$3-4USD_ for our International listeners). It's not a lot so make sure you compliment the artists with a quick purchase. Without further ado, I give you - _Something Dirty_. ![Something Dirty CD Cover](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1316/1203118682_eec89c8f10.jpg?v=0 "Something Dirty CD Cover")

I know its completely different to the type of music you'd normally find in the podcast but I also know there are listeners out there who will really enjoy this. Maybe the mixing isn't up to scratch but, hopefully, the work from the artists will be enough to impress you. Let me know what you think. If there is enough demand, I will consider making this a more regular thing.
