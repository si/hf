**Three hundred sessions. Wild. To mark the milestone, Si has stitched together a signature OPDJ journey packed with soulful goodness, big disco moments and a handful of personal picks from our resident crew. It's a proper celebration mix, a nod to nearly two decades of House Finesse and the amazing community that has grown around it.**

Settle in, turn it up and enjoy the ride.

If you're feeling the journey, drop a comment, share it with your crew and support the artists however you can.
