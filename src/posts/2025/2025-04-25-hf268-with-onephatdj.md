## 🏃‍♂️ Support Si’s 21km Half Marathon for Dementia UK

On 21 May, I’m running a half marathon to raise money for Dementia UK, a cause that’s close to the hearts of all of us at House Finesse.

Each of us in the crew has seen loved ones affected by dementia, and this is our way of giving something back. Dementia UK provides incredible specialist nurses who support families living with dementia — and your donations go directly toward that care.

👉 [Please donate if you can](https://www.justgiving.com/page/21km-for-dementia)

Even the cost of a coffee can make a difference. Big love to everyone supporting this. 💙
