<p>Another classy selection from LYP, digging into jazz-tinged house, Afro grooves and big-room re-edits with that warm, heads-down energy. This one flows from smooth operator vibes into peak-time classics, with a few cheeky mash-ups and a remix from the man himself.</p>
<p>Expect keys, basslines and proper swing. No rush, just groove.</p>
