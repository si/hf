**Behind the 12th door of the House Finesse advent calendar is Taylan, one of our younger regular DJs and an exciting name coming out of the Midlands right now.**

This session is all about groove-led garage and dirty basslines that do the talking. There's even an unreleased Taylan opener in here, setting the tone from the first minute.

A perfect advent treat. Turn it up, lock in and keep an eye on our Taylan.

If you're feeling the mix, drop a comment, share it with your crew and support the artists however you can.
