Massive love to our ⏻ Supporter Al Mayers who's always sharing his love on the socials and keeping the family connected! 🎶🔥

A huge thank you to everyone who supported and donated for last week's half marathon for Dementia UK – we absolutely smashed the goal (financially and physically) and raised over £1,200! 🙏 Every bit of that support helps make a real difference.
