<p>Sarah Jae is back in the booth after a few busy months and she has not held back. HF310 is stacked with disco sparkle, chunky house drums and a few cheeky reworks that will have you clocking every vocal from the first bar.</p>
<p>From Crazy P and Cerrone through to Todd Terry and ATFC, this one glides between feel good nostalgia and proper dancefloor punch. There are nods to Donna Summer, New Order and Depeche Mode via fresh edits, plus some slick modern heat from Prospa and Disclosure. It is a welcome return and she sounds locked in.</p>
<p>Turn it up. Send it to your mates. Let’s go.</p>
