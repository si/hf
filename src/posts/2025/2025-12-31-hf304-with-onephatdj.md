HF304 kicks off Season 26 in style.

To close out 2025 and welcome in the New Year, One Phat DJ digs into a hand-picked selection of favourites from across the past twelve months. Expect big soulful moments, disco-fuelled warmth and proper hands-in-the-air house, all built for late nights and loud sound systems.

This mix also marks the official launch of the House Finesse 2026 rebrand. Fresh artwork. New audio idents. A refreshed line-up. Same love for house music and the community thatâs grown around it over the past 20 years.

Turn it up wherever you're seeing in the New Year, and welcome to Season 26.
