**Halloween's here and One Phat DJ is back with another monster mix of soulful, disco and uplifting house to light up your spooky weekend.**

From disco revivals to gospel grooves and funky floorfillers, expect plenty of tributes to the late, great Ron Carroll alongside the usual soulful suspects.

Twenty-five years ago today I sealed my first kiss with my better half at a student Halloween party - me as a Ghostbuster, her as Catwoman. A match made in heaven. Love you, bab! ❤️
