**INSERT INTRODUCTION**

## Our shop is open

This week, we've also launched a [HOT NEW HOUSE FINESSE SHOP](/shop/) on Teemill.

We have a range of t-shirts, hoodies and sweaters with memorable quotes, song lyrics and much more to come, all ethically sourced and printed on-demand so there's no waste.
