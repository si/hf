**INSERT INTRODUCTION**

This week, we've also launched a [HOT NEW HOUSE FINESSE SHOP](/shop/) on Teemill. 
We have a range of t-shirts, hoodies and sweaters with memorable quotes, song lyrics and much more to come, all made ethically and on-demand so there's no waste.
For our launch weekend, we're offering **more than 20% off RRP PLUS free delivery**, most t-shirts for just Â£19 - final orders will be Monday 1 April 2024 at midnight UTC (remember those clocks go forward to Summer Time on Sunday in the UK!)
Grab your own HF merch and wear it with pride wherever you enjoy house music.
