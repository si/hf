In the second installment of One Phat DJ's "_Best Of 2007_" series, we turn things up a little to the next level, introducing some tunes that aren't akin to all those trendy bars warming up the crowds before the clubs. This is a selection of tracks that have tickled my fancy through 2007 and should do the same for all the regular listeners out there. If you're a bit partial to the likes of Fierce Angel, Hed Kandi, Defected and Ministry of Sound, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this. Ladies and gents, I give you _Episode 38_ of the [One Phat DJ Podcast](https://feeds.feedburner.com/onephatdj), "**Best Of 2007, Pt 2 - Crescendo**".

### Description

The pioneer of British house music _Dave Lee_ kicks off the very female biassed proceedings for the second time with the under-rated track _Too Much Information_, a perfect choice to set the pace of the next hour of funky house tunes. While it might be a late comer in the year, _Chanel_ then initiates the foot tapping and side-stepping with her infectious "_Dance_" offering. We are then treated to the vocal talents of _Rietta Austin_, another firm Hed Kandi favourite which I've been playing over and over again throughout 2007. Before you can catch a breath, those Booty Luv girls bless us with my preferred release from the duo in 2007, "_Shine_" (even if the late Luther Vandross did the better version before his estate recalled all Freemason remixes from the album). The huge voice of _Taka Boom_ is not far behind with her party anthem "_Treat Me Right_" before _The Wideboys_ resample of "_The Bomb_" keeps the tempo going with their (still) un-released beauty. Fellow label signing _Dannii Minogue_ get's her awe in their too with her collaboration with Jason Nevins before its time for some _Defected_ favourites. _Barbara Tucker_ and _Una Mass_ know how to deliver their vocal talents and their treats in 2007 surely delivered. We then get a piece of Seamus Haji's Big Love thanks to another One Phat Favourite in the form of _D'Empress_ and _Ijah_. _Starchaser_ and _Shena_ keep the momentum going with "_Let Your Mind Go Free_" before we break things down a little with the dubby but still upbeat "_Miami Sun_" from _Chic Flowerz_. What better way to wrap up the mix than with the _Freemasons_ and _Siedah Garret_ with the Walken remix of "_Rain Down Love_", ideally setting the scene for Part 3 of the series.
