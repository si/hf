### Description

We start things off on a slower tangent with **Wez Clarke & Maxine Hardcastle**'s "_Walking With A Smile_", a track from Hed Kandi's Beach 2008 compilation. If you haven't got the album, get it. It's perfect not only for chillaxing on the beach but for those times when you're lounging around at home in the evening with a drink or two. Next up is one of my favourite producers of all time, **Joey Negro**, delivering two stunning productions. The first is the belting disco-infused **Sunburst Band** with "_Fly Away_" which I can't get enough of at the moment. This is quickly followed up by Z Records milestone 100th release, "_Love Hangover_", which samples the classic riff from **Diana Ross**' 1976 hit by the same name. After this, you're treated to **Steven Stone** and the uplifting vocals of **Andrea Love** with "_Good Love_" from [Stereo Sushi version 13](https://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(20047)a(1254950)g(606309)url(https://www.play.com/Music/MP3-Download-Album/4-/6201076/Stereo-Sushi-Version-13/Product.html) "Buy Stereo Sushi version 13 from Play for just Â£9.95") and an appearance from one of my favourite vocalists on the house scene **Georgie Porgie** with "_Can You Feel That Sound_". Following this is a sweet little remix of **Mariah Carey**'s "_I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time_" by [DJRoman](https://www.indabamusic.com/people/djroman) as part of the remix competition on [Indaba Music](https://www.indabamusic.com/contests/show/mariah) - definitely my favourite among the many entries. It's not long before we cool things off a little with **Sound Of Joy**'s "_Now Or Never_", a funky vocal number that is sure to get rumps shifting, then we turn things up a notch with the latest project from everyone's favourite, Brighton's **Freemasons**. They've snapped up the **Funk Fanatics**' "_Love Is The Answer_" on their Free Maison label, added their personal touch to the disco number, ready to throw it in to the limelight. I'm sure you'll find that infectious loop will stick in your head for days! Now it's time to bring back those oh-so-popular commercial remixers **Moto Blanco** with a few tracks from their vault. First up is a track from last year's World Aids Day campaign with **Annie Lennox** and a whole host of other famous ladies (including **Madonna**) getting the synth and strings treatment on "_Sing_". This is shortly followed up with lady of the moment and sister of **Beyonce**, **Solange Knowles** and her fantastic new track "_I Decided_". There are quite a few catchy remixes doing the rounds at the moment, including an impressive effort from the **Freemasons**, but it was Moto Blanco's reworking that did it for me. After **Levi5** and **Michelle Martinez** treat us to "_Third Time_", it's time for **Hed Kandi**'s latest revival offering in the guise of **No Halo**'s "_Put Your Hands On_". I can't get enough of this track at the moment, mainly because of the sample from **Johnny Corporate**'s "_Sunday Shoutin'_". **Paul Harris**, **Ian Masterson**, **Therese** and **Lauren Rose** have outdone themselves. With Hed Kandi out the way, it's time for some **Audio Freak** productions, starting off with **Soulshaker**'s remixes of **Juliet Robert**'s "_Slow Down_" and **Kathy Brown**'s "_Sounds Of The City_" then going into the **Bassmonkey**'s remix of **Eugene**'s "_Falling_" - three awesome examples of upbeat funky house at its finest. Now it's time for my favourite tune of all time on the remix with **7th Heaven**. At first, I thought it was blasphemous. But after a few listens, I was convinced. It's impossible to ignore the sheer power of **Degrees of Motion** and "_Shine On_". You just try to not enjoy it. From here on in, we get a little "Twisted". It commences with **Jon Fitz**'s remix of "_Hesitate_", **Richard Murray**'s "_Set Me Free_" and **Sasha Angel**'s "_Keep Shining_". Regular vocalist **Katherine Ellis** makes a welcome return to the podcast featuring in **McCall**'s "_Gotta Get Through_" before **Roxanne Wilde** takes the mic in **Milk & Sugar**'s Summer anthem "_No No No_". You then get stung by the anthemic piano loops of **James Dornan**'s "_Everythings Gonna Be Alright_" and **Brinsley Evan**'s "_That New Sound_", building you up into a real crescendo before I drop the collaboration of the season - **Axwell, Bob Sinclar and Ron Carroll**'s "_What A Wonderful World_". While the original version is a little cheesy, the **Dabruck & Klein** remix oozes energy through the breakdowns and build ups. After **Out of Office**'s "_Insatiable_", we delve into the past with a fantastic and filthy 2008 remix of **Cevin Fisher** and **Loleatta Holloway**'s "_Got Me Burning Up_". Any sensible DJ would have this tune in his box this season to ensure maximum bounce-factor in the clubs. And why not wrap up the mix with tune of the Summer - **Fred Falke**'s remix of **Defected**'s success story that is **The Montanas and DJ Roland Clark** with "_Music Talking_" - perfect to bring the podcast to an end. How does that do you?
