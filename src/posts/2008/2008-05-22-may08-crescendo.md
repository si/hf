It's been a ridiculously busy month! Not content with handing in my notice at [Yahoo!](https://uk.yahoo.com/) as well as releasing [Euro KickOff](https://www.eurokickoff.com/), there has also been [an interview with Paul Velocity](https://www.simonjobling.com/blog/2008/paul-velocity-presents) (which also features a 30 minute mix) and there is another interview still to come (details soon). If that wasn't enough, I've also managed to fit in time to continue producing the [One Phat DJ Podcast](https://onephatdj.com/podcast) for all you lovely, lovely people out there. How do I ever find time for myself as well? So, here it is - it's time to turn your speakers up and download _Episode 47_ - the **May '08 Crescendo**.

### Details

There are some fantastic uplifting tracks in this mix, covering quite a broad spectrum of the funky house scene (even if some of the latter tracks might break the boundaries of "funky"). I've been hammering the first track "_Lift Him Up_" to death over the last month - the huge vocals of **Linda Lee Hopkins** certainly grab your attention, especially with the addictive beat and hooky bassline. **Warren Clarke** supplies the lush sounds that certainly wouldn't sound out of place on any Hed Kandi release with his dangerously titled "_Bitch Is Back_" - catchy vocals and immense uplifting loops make this a firm favourite for my Summer. We also get an _exclusive_ play from the **Bassmonkeys** with their latest production in the form of a remix of **Etherfox**'s "_More Man Than Man_" - a typically loud and uplifting production with fantastic vocals from our boys from Norwich. It would have been rude to let **The Shapeshifters** funky dub track "_Treadstone_" slip through the net as well. I'm so glad Max and Simon have returned this year and hope to hear a lot more funky numbers like this, maybe with some vocals next time eh boys? Being a bit of a sucker for some catchy rapping over dance numbers, when I discovered "_Direct Connection_" from **Sean Biddle** and **Krukid**, I was hooked. I'm sure I won't be alone in this though. Let me know what you think. After a few more funky numbers from the likes of regular vocalists **Shena** and **Nicole Tyler**, things suddenly take a turn to yesteryear, starting off with **G & G**'s reworking of **Armand Van Helden**'s massive "_My My My_" with **Gary Wright** on the vocals, shortly followed up with **Micha Moor**'s reworking of **Prodigy**'s "_Outta Space_". We wrap things up with another familiar face on the scene with **Amanda Wilson** lending some superb vocals towards the rollercoaster ride of **A Lee**'s "_Gotta Let Go_", with a final polishing from **Chris Ortega**. It was quite difficult selecting just 13 tracks for this mix as there was such a fantastic selection released in April and May but I hope you agree the final cut are perfect.
