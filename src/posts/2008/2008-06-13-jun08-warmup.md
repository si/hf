What a long "fortnight" that has been! It seems an age ago since [May '08 Crescendo](https://www.simonjobling.com/blog/2008/may08-crescendo/) was released but that's the beauty of the new format - occasionally I get a nice, long break between releases. That's not to say I've been lounging around doing nothing. There have been literally _thousands_ of tracks released to check out in the mean time and I've been a busy bee going through them all, sorting out the musical treats to grace your lovely ears. We kick off the month with quite a laid back mix, featuring some lush tracks from the likes of **Bobby D'Ambrosio**, **Kings of Tomorrow**, **DJ Roland Clark**, **Byron Stingily**, **Shawn Christopher** and **Pepper Mashay** to name but a few. We're definitely on a Summer vibe with this beauty so I suggest you download the mix, turn those speakers up and enjoy in the sunshine, whether you're driving with the windows open or kicking back with an ice cold drink in the garden. Before you do all that though, we need to introduce this month's guest artist. **Gemma Barton** of Manchester's [Big Light Studio](https://www.biglightstudio.co.uk/) has delivered a fantastic piece, emphasising the music and Summer feeling, all in to one bright vivid cover for this mix. I think you'll agree its stunning and sets the scene perfectly. Expect more magic from Gemma in two weeks time...
