![Plain & Simple](images/plain_and_simple_200px.gif) It's that time of the year where your workload is getting ever higher but morale is getting lower due to the Winter blues. Either that or you just ready for Christmas and the New Year (maybe a mixture of the two). With that in mind, I've taken it upon myself to attempt to cheer up all you party animals out there with the latest installment from One Phat DJ - [Plain & Simple](https://www.funkyhousetunes.com/mp3/onephatdj/plain_and_simple.mp3). Another 10-track promo of the latest and funkiest of funky house including tracks from those guys who seem to have to put their name on every track this year, the Freemasons, as well as the likes of The Hound Dogs, Joey Negro, Silosonic and some oldies from Delacy and The Source thanks to remixes by the Young Punx and Shapeshifters respectively.

1. Delacy - Hideaway 2005 (Young Punx Mix)
2. Hound Dogs - I Like Girls (Phunk Investigation Fantasy Mix)
3. Joey Negro - Make A Move On Me (Joey Negro Club Mix)
4. Silosonic - Something (To Make You Feel Alright) (Buzz Kitchen Remix)
5. The Source ft Candi Staton - You Got The Love (Shapeshifters Main Mix)
6. Porno - Music Power (Vocal Mix)
7. Freemasons - Watchin' (Vox)
8. Afropeans ft Inaya Day - Better Things (Syke N' Sugarstarr Remix)
9. Public DJ ft Emanuelle - My Night (Kortezman Vocal Mix)
10. The House Keepers - Go Down (Thomas Falke Remix)

If you need a hit of funky fresh tunes, go [download the mix](https://www.funkyhousetunes.com/mp3/onephatdj/plain_and_simple.mp3) right now.

There is also a poor attempt at a Christmas-orientated [CD cover available for download](/wp-content/plain_and_simple_sleeve_300dpi.jpg) if you want to print one off. Have yourself a funky little Christmas and an even funkier new year!!
