This week marks the start of a new chapter on House Finesse as we welcome Taylan as an official resident. This is his first mix of many for Season 26, and he sets the tone perfectly with a deep, groove-led session that sits right on the line between house and garage.

Expect rolling basslines, late-night pressure, and that subtle swing that keeps everything moving without shouting. It’s confident, patient mixing with plenty of character, exactly how we like it.

There’s also a proper treat in the middle of the set, an exclusive unreleased collaboration from Nathxno and Taylan, dropped here first for the House Finesse family.

A strong debut residency, a clear sound, and a resident we’re buzzing to have on board.
