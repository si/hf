LYP steps up for HF307 with a classy, heads-down house session that moves effortlessly between deep grooves, rolling percussion and late-night vocal moments. This one is built for dark rooms and long blends; warm, hypnotic and quietly confident.

Expect modern house pressure, tasteful edits and a standout LYP remix to close things out. Proper dancefloor energy without the rush.

As always, turn it up loud and enjoy the ride.
