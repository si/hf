This week we are buzzing to bring you a proper family affair with a special collaboration from the Love Sensation crew. A full 60 minutes of uplifting, soulful, disco-driven energy that is all about connection, community and pure dancefloor joy.

Love Sensation have been flying the flag for quality house and disco for years, building a warm, inclusive scene around their events and radio shows. We are proud to link up with them for this one, especially as our very own Andi King is a regular resident in the Love Sensation family and a big part of their story.

Expect rolling grooves, feel-good vocals, classy disco cuts and that unmistakable Love Sensation warmth from start to finish. Perfect for the gym, the car, the kitchen or a late-night session with the lights low and the volume up.
