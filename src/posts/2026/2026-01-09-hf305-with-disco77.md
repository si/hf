S26E02 lands with Disco77 digging deep behind the sofa for a proper curveball of a mix. A cheeky, high energy session full of bootlegs, disco licks and flashes of speed garage; random in the best possible way and stacked with fun from start to finish.

There’s no track listing on this one yet, which feels very on brand for a behind-the-sofa selection. Expect the unexpected, guilty pleasures and moments that catch you off guard and make you grin.
