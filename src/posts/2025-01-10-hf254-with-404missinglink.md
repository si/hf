> I want to thank Si for inviting me on to House Finesse to showcase my guest mix. Going into this mix I wanted to make something very me. I grew up on deep house and it's the genre that's stayed with me the longest, even though I'm probably more well known for my minimal antics these days. It's a genre that's unbelievably versatile and in this mix we go as deep underground as I can possibly take you with some tunes I dusted off from days gone by and some brand new gorgeous records that I've been sitting on for the right mix. It's supposed to be a journey.
> Big love, 404MissingLink
