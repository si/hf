## A little about Ben

Ben Santiago is one of the White Isle's most prolific DJs. Since moving to Ibiza seven years ago he has held a number of enviable residencies and played for the biggest brands in the industry, including; Café del Mar, Cream, Pacha, Base Bar, El Divino, Ibiza Rocks, Cocoon, Amnesia, Es Vive, Manumission, and Hed Kandi – who  have appointed him Ibiza resident for the third year running at their parties at Es Paradis in 2012. He is also an official A&R scout for Hed Kandi / Ministry of Sound, helping compile the music for their world famous compilations.

Appreciated for his truly Balearic approach (as showcased on his weekly Ministry Of Sound radio show and guest mix on [Hed Kandi's Beach House 2011](https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=23708&a=1254950&url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fgb%2Falbum%2Fhed-kandi-beach-house-2011%2Fid438472616%3Fuo%3D4%26partnerId%3D2003)), Ben is just as passionate spinning eclectic sets at villa and beach parties or on catwalks and yachts as he is delivering straight up house tunes in a club. His success is based on a simple premise: Whatever the genre, if a track is going to connect with the audience then I'll play it....
