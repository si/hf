We're trying some alternative channels for delivering the finest selection of house music to our audience with music listening habits evolving over the past decade.

Youtube is clearly one of the most popular platforms for finding and listening to new music so we've setup a dedicated playlist for March 2016. If it's something you think works, let us know and we'll continue.

We've also setup a similar playlist on Soundcloud to see how that engages too. Again, let us know your thoughts.
