**With the biggest music conference of the season in full swing, our very own Gweilo has put together a special ADE16 mini-mix for us all to enjoy.**

Gweilo has been very busy over recent months, producing four new tracks, all lined up to be released on Marshall Jefferson's Freakin 909 label in November. Be sure to follow [Gweilo on Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/artist/gweilo/287470) for early access.

As an added bonus, we'll be giving away a prize to the first person who can correctly identify all the tracks featured in the mix. Post your suggestions in the comments section for your chance to get our special treat.

Remember to share the love of the mix; post on your social channels with hashtag **#housefinesse**. We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Finally, there will be a special mix produced on the run up to Christmas. What's been your favourite track of the year? We'll pick the favourites and create a Finesse of Finesse mix.
