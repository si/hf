We return to the airwaves with another two hours of funky house delights, this week with a mix of new _and old_. After the passing of the legend last week, we honour **Michael Jackson** for the last hour of this week's show with a special hour mix of the finest remixes with a funky house vibe over the last 15 years. Expect to hear all the classics remixed by a whole host of producers through the years, including the **Freemasons**, **Frankie Knuckles**, **Junior Vasquez**, **Masters At Work**, **Tony Moran** and even a cheeky **Daft Punk** mashup. We kick the show off though with another fine production from our favourite Australian artist **Rachel Claudio**, followed up with some sexy, uplifting soulful house tunes. Unfortunately, we don't have time for any Disco Tech tunes this week but don't worry - we'll catch up in two weeks time. Our favourite voiceover **Ben Day** returns this week too after his Summer break. We got mixed reactions to Si's attempt at covering so we'll leave the talking to the pro's. With all that said and done, make sure you leave some feedback on the mix, especially the MJ Tribute mix. It would be great to know what you thought of the feature. ![Funky House Finesse 7 - 4th July 2009](images/funky_house_finesse_7_4th_july_2009-1024x1024.jpg "Funky House Finesse 7 - 4th July 2009")
