Now all the closing parties of Ibiza are over, what are we meant to do for a dose of decent, uplifting house music? I'll tell you what - you grab yourself a copy of the latest Funky House Finesse show, turn it up loud and pretend you're still on the White Isle, either warming up on the terrace, having a boogie in the clubs or chilling out under the sunrise.

Prepare for the likes of **DJ Meme**, **DJ Dan** and **DJ Chus**, **Pepper Mashay**, **Barbara Tucker** and **Gabriella Cilmi**, **Chocolate Puma**, **Superfunk** and **Dirty South**. We've also got the brand new monster track from **Duck Sauce**, the new guise for **Armand Van Helden** and **A-Trax**. Armand returns to his routes with an infectious disco house beauty which is going to be massive. If you're on Twitter, make sure you follow [One Phat DJ](https://twitter.com/onephatdj) and the [Funky House Finesse team](https://twitter.com/housefinesse) to keep up-to-date with the latest news.
