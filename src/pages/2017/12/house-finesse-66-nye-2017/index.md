We couldn't say goodbye to 2017 without a special mix of some of One Phat DJ's favourite tunes from the past few months.

As you've probably noticed, House Finesse mixes are becoming a bit more sporadic now, partly due to other (family) commitments for all the resident DJs. If you want a more regular dose of house delights, we highly recommend [Defected's podcast](https://soundcloud.com/defectedrecords) including the weekly **Glitterbox Radio Show** with Melvo Baptiste and **Defected Radio Show** with (former guest DJ) Sam Divine.

We will be lining up some more guest mixes for 2018, thrown amongst some resident offerings - watch this space!

As always, holler on our social channels - **@housefinesse** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/housefinesse) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HouseFinesse/).
