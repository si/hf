**For the first May Bank Holiday, Lemon Yellow Pea returns with a delightfully relaxing selection of sun-set tunes for show #70.**

One half of Souljackerz, Stu Braybrooke (aka Lemon Yellow Pea or even LYP) recorded this set atÂ Pavillion in Colchester UK last month. It's the perfect soundtrack to the start of the British summer as people prepare for a sun-drenched weekend of fun and relaxation.

Turn it up load and enjoy with an ice cold drink and friends.
