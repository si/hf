**Manchester is in the house as DJ Cruze brings us another guest mix in the 7th part of our _#ONEPHATDECADE_ celebrations.**

Back in 2005 when I was starting to investigate music podcasts, DJ Cruze was a huge inspiration for me. His mixing was impeccable and favoured music genres were full of energy. I used to look forward to Christmas as he regularly remixed a classic Christmas track for his listeners. Whilst I shied away from recording voiceovers for the podcast, DJ Cruze was no stranger to the mic which added his cheeky Northern personality to a top quality show. (His better half even recording the original idents for the _One Phat DJ Podcast_.)

As one of the early DJs from the Manchester rave scene, Cruze is no stranger to house music either. He's honed his musical selection and production techniques through the years. In fact, he's got such a good ear for music, he can easily identify samples of new music from their original counterparts. I dare you to challenge him!

DJ Cruze has been such a huge part of our podcast journey, we were mega-keen to get him to join in the _#ONEPHATDECADE_ season so, after a long break from producing, we were absolutely honoured when he accepted. With this special trip down Memory Lane, selecting some of his favourite tunes from the past 10 years, you shall not be disappointed.

Be sure to follow DJ Cruze on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/housedjcruze), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djcruze) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/dj-cruze), as well as on [his own website](https://www.djcruze.co.uk/) where he plans to relaunch his podcast.

**Rave on!**
