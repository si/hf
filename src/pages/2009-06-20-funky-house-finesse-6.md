This is the 6th episode of **Funky House Finesse with One Phat DJ** and for the next two hours, you'll be treated to some of the finest and funkiest house tracks released in the last few weeks. ![Funky House Finesse 6 - 20th June 2009](images/funky-house-finesse-6-20th-june-2009.jpg "Funky House Finesse 6 - 20th June 2009") Your usual voiceover [Ben Day](https://www.benday.org/) has taken a well-deserved Summer break this week so (unfortunately for you) I'll be taking the mic instead. Bear with me while I get used to the whole mic setup. It's a little daunting for a DJ whose stuck behind the decks for over 10 years. We'll see how it goes this week - I may be back in the future... We'll be playing a whole range of new material on this beautiful Saturday evening, featuring the likes of **Cerrone**, **Ralf Gum**, **Rasmus Faber**, **Wamdue Project**, **Peyton**, **No Halo**, **Rachel Claudio**, **Nate James**, **Coolio**(!), **Studiopunks**, **The Face**, **Milk & Sugar**, **Booty Luv** and **Lee Cabrera** - you will not be disappointed! Don't forget to hook up with One Phat DJ online - you can find me on the popular social networks like [twitter.com/onephatdj](https://twitter.com/onephatdj) and the [Funky House Finesse Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4894384789), plus some lesser-known sites like [Last FM](https://www.last.fm/users/onephatdj) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=785DA71931DAC12D). We would also love to hear from all you lovely listeners out there. Drop us a line on any of those social networks, leave a comment on the website or, even, send us photos, videos and phone messages. We'll be sure to mention any shout outs in future shows so get them in quick! One final shout out must go to our resident [illustrator Sam "Nocturnal Monkey" Hardacre](https://nocturnalmonkey.com/) who has returned and supplied the fine artwork for this week's show. It's great to have him back on the team and we look forward to many more inspirational pieces in the future.
