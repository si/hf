For those who actually visit the site rather than just subscribe through iTunes, you may have noticed we've had a lick of paint.

The previous design was missing that polished look, something just didn't feel right. With 2018 approaching and a cheeky little [NYE mix from One Phat DJ](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/house-finesse-nye-2017/), it felt like the ideal opportunity to have a tidy up.

Clearer navigation, more consistent branding and space for the artwork and music to breathe along with quick links to our favourite social channels on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/housefinesse), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/housefinesse), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaFavPu3o0c&list=PL7E01F60784D32727) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/house-finesse/id355833875).

No doubt there will be minor changes throughout the year as deemed appropriate but we thought it only fair to explain ourselves for those who care about these things.

The eagle eyed may also notice we’ve now made the website more secure too - all the web traffic is on HTTPS rather than the plain HTTP. This is to improve your experience, make sure you’ve got a genuine content from us with no chance of “man in the middle” interferences.
