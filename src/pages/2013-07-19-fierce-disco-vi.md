Of all the Fierce Angel releases, Fierce Disco is the most popular - and, from my perspective, I know why. It represents the signature sound label boss Mark Doyle pioneered back in the days he established Hed Kandi: an eclectic selection of soulful, disco, vocal and deep house tracks produced by the world's finest artists. Many of those original artists are still present as well - The Brand New Heavies, Peyton, Eric Kupper, even Freemasons (in different guises) to name a few - a good indication of the loyalty both artists and fans share with Mark's visions.

Fierce Disco VI not only represents the sounds of old though - there are a number of upcoming new acts included as well. There are eight unreleased anthems signed to the compilation from the likes of Paaniq, Alf Tumble and Fibes Oh Fibes.

Stand out tracks for me include the opening anthem **Sunlight from Brand New Heavies** (how can you not enjoy that sound?), **Rise Up from Auckland House Authority** and the **Freemasons' comeback track "Bring It Back"**.

To compliment the release, Fierce Angel have introduced fashion photographer Luke Woodford to direct the artwork. Whilst quite moody, I love the direction they're taking with this, away from the cliche bikinis towards true fashion.

Fierce Angel will also be touring the globe to promote Fierce Disco VI stopping around Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Canada, Bulgaria, Brighton, Scotland and Birmingham.
