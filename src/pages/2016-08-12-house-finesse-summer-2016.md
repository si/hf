## Summer time is officially here and, with it comes another hour mix of the finest house music selection for your delight.

It may look like a Radio 1 Dance playlist and that's for good reason - it's been an exciting few months for house music with plenty belters being released for the summer party season from our commercial-friendly favourites. To see **Nile Rodgers** collaborate with one of my favourite male vocalists says it all. I've had to pull in some of my other favourites of the past few years: the amazing **Jess Glynne**, disco-hero **OPOLOPO**, the **Disclosure** duo, reviver **Lee Walker** - you see where I'm coming from.

The surprise summer hit from **DJ S.K.T** is a permanent fixture on my playlist too - he's smashed it with his brave but infectious remix of **Bel Biv Devo**'s "Poison" - one of my favourite R&B tracks of the 90s. Love it!

With that, let's turn it up, cue it up and continue to enjoy this glorious summer.

Be sure to share the love with your friends across [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/housefinesse), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/housefinesse), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/housefinesse), Snapchat, WhatsApp… whatever – and let's get _#housefinesse_ trending!
