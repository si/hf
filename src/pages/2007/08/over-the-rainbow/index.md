It's official - this has been the worst British Summer this millennium! The weather has been terrible and dampened spirits as well as the general landmass of the UK. I know there has been some terrible news coming from the vast amounts of rain but the name of this mix is an attempt to look past the negative side of the weather, focusing more on the bright side of things (with a few camp connotations thrown in for good measure). With all the crazy things taking over my life over the last few months, I'm hoping the listeners out there will forgive me for the lateness of the July edition of the podcast. Anyway, quit your winging and check out the tunes. ![Over The Rainbow cover](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1119/1147485071_53c74d0c8f.jpg?v=0 "Over The Rainbow cover")

### Track Listings

1. _Beyonce_ - “Green Light” (Freemasons Remix) I'm kicking off this podcast with something completely commercial for once. Beyonce has recently had a stint of records relying entirely on the Freemasons making them sound good, starting off with Deja Vu (definitely sounding better than the original), followed up with her collaboration with bum-shaking Shakira (two of the sexiest artists from the Americas and all that dancing certainly looked better at a faster tempo) and now with the synths and beats treatment on Green Light (which is definitely an improvement on the tediously slow album version). Some might say it all sounds very similar but there's no arguing the fact that if the Freemasons' weren't around, would Beyonce? I seriously doubt she'd be doing as well. Released under _Sony BMG_ on **27 July 2007**, available to download from [iTunes](https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=260422427&s=143444). Time _00m 00s_
2. _Paul Gardner & Hugh Gunnell ft Angie Brown_ - “Make My Love” (Original) Lifting the tempo straight away (and veering away from the commercial stuff at the same time), its time for Paul Gardner and Hugh Gunnell with the legendary vocalist Angie Brown. This is a great funky number, full of catchy synth loops in true podcast style. Angie lends her voice perfectly to this track although I feel the lyrics could have done with some work. Hopefully, we can expect a radio friendly version with additional lyrics in the near future. Released under _Housonic_ on **16 July 2007**, available to download from [DJ Download](https://www.djdownload.com/click/Th042iwFhCCZE22rNAa/468) and [Traxsource](https://www.traxsource.com/index.php?act=show&fc=tpage&cr=titles&cv=10404). Time _04m 09s 28ms_
3. _Justin Michael ft Jackie Wilson_ - “Funky Love” (Born To Funk Remix) As if Paul, Hugh and Angie didn't warm you up enough, its time for Justin Michael and Jackie Wilson to take the reins and don't they do so in style? I dare you to listen to this track just the once without skipping back. Those infectious synths will have you jumping around like a loon and Ms Wilson's minimal but sweet vocals should make sure you're well and truly on your way to a funky crescendo. Released under _Swank Recordings_ on **23 April 2007**, available to download from [Traxsource](https://www.traxsource.com/index.php?act=show&fc=tpage&cr=titles&cv=7841). Time _10m 24s 28ms_
4. _Starchaser ft Shena_ - “Let Your Mind Go” (Original Radio Edit) Surely you remember the lovely Shena from De Souza's “Guilty” earlier in the year? Well, she's back with yet more fresh vocals in this great tune, accompanying producer Starchaser with a track full of synths, strings and pure unadulterated funk. Whether this track will actually surface on the commercial scene is a different topic but you can be sure to expect it will get some awesome support around the clubs over the next few months. Get word out, make this a huge hit! Released under _Ego_ on **28 June 2007**. Available to download from [DJ Download](https://www.djdownload.com/click/Th042iwFhCCZE22rNAa/473). Time _15m 54s 280ms_
5. _Hot 22_ - “Before I Let You In” (Original) It's those Italian producers again - they're back with yet another huge hot tune to pump out your speakers (or headphones). I can't for the life of me work out where they've sampled these vocals from but you can be sure its hidden away in te dungeons of some old Motown or disco archive. With all those synths and strings thrown in for good measure, one thing is certain - its a sweet tune that is sure to make it on to some of this year's mixes and compilations. Released under _Housexy_ on **21 May 2007**, available to download from [DJ Download](https://www.djdownload.com/click/Th042iwFhCCZE22rNAa/469). Time _20m 24s 28ms_
6. _Soul Avengerz ft Katherine Ellis_ - “One Love” (Original) One Phat favourites Soul Avengerz and Katherine Ellis are back with yet more big room beats that are sure to keep pulses raised. “One Love” is a funk-fuelled disco masterpiece, with sweet vocals and more jammy guitar riffs you could shake a stick at. Released under _Housexy_ on **21 May 2007**, available to download from [DJ Download](https://www.djdownload.com/click/Th042iwFhCCZE22rNAa/470). Time _25m 54s 28ms_
7. _Chic Flowerz_ - “Miami Sun” (Original) I tend to avoid instrumental tracks in the podcast for no other reason that the podcast is dedicated to vocal funky house (although some tracks do seem to be quite minimal on the lyrics). However, this track from Chic Flowerz is so damned funky, I had to drop it. Oozing with typical disco sounds and a great hooky loop, you'd struggle to keep your feet still to this one. Released under _Hed Kandi_ on **18 May 2007**, available to download from [DJ Download](https://www.djdownload.com/click/Th042iwFhCCZE22rNAa/471). Time _32m 24s 28ms_
8. _The Wideboys_ - “Bomb (The Secret)” (Moto Blanco Club Mix) There have been loads of bootlegs going around recently of The Buckethead's “The Bomb”. It's been a tough call deciding on a favourite but I've had to give in and endorse the more radio friendly Wideboys version. Funnily enough, the majority of the original has been stripped out in this reworking with some sublime synth loops and completely new vocals from Clare Evers, you might even class this as a mashup, barely borrowing those classic trumpet samples to add some familiarity. Regardless, its a tune and I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that. Released under _AATW_ with a launch date to be announced. Time _36m 35s 47ms_
9. _Booty Luv_ – “Don’t Mess With My Man” (Seamus Haji Big Love Remix) It was inevitable that we hadn't heard the last from the Booty Luv crowd. Having firmly established themselves as the biggest dance act of the year, they've returned with a remixed cover of Lucy Pearl's “Don't Mess With My Man”, a track I was waiting to be remixed since it's release in 2000. The original had one of the most catchy basslines of the year so it was a pleasant surprise to hear these guys had covered it (although I'm not sure they can take all the credit). Anyway, all the ingredients you'd come to expect from Booty Luv are in there - catchy vocals and samples perfect for the club and radio, unfortunately minus the awesome bassline I was looking forward to. Released under _Hed Kandi_ on **3 September 2007**, available to buy from [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000UYT9DU/sjmedia-21), with an album to follow on **17 September 2007**. Time _43m 03s 56ms_
10. _Wawa vs Smax & Gold_ - “Stranger” (Wawa Remix) Now I wouldn't normally get so excited about a remix of a pop tune but this track has changed me. I'm probably going to regret putting a US teeny popstar in the podcast but I'm glad to say the likes of Wawa, Eric Smax and Thomas Gold have done Hilary Duff some justice with this remix (although the lack of credits in the title might be intentional). The chorus has a fantastic uplifting feel about it which well and truly nailed the tune for me. It's already gaining huge commercial appeal on the radio so expect to hear more later in the year. Released under _EMI_ with a launch date to be announced. Time _48m 50s 47ms_
11. _Doc Da Funk_ - “Real Love” (Original) As we reach the peak of the mix, it's time for some slightly tougher sounds, this time compliments of Liverpool-based DJ _Doc Da Funk_. This remix of _Drizabone_ form the early 90's would sound awesome in a club with that huge bassline. It has a distinctive _Big Love_ sound to this track so I wouldn't be surprised if you hear it commercially later in the year. Released under _Boss Records_ on **27 July 2007**, available to download from [DJ Download](https://www.djdownload.com/click/Th042iwFhCCZE22rNAa/472). Time _53m 21s 07ms_
12. _Byron Stingily_ - “Get Up (Everybody)” (Steve Mac Remix) I'm sure everyone can remember this classic. I don't really think it needs any introductions or reasons as to why its in the mix apart from the fact Steve Mac has done himself proud with this remix, leaving the majority of the track untouched, allowing it to gain more commercial appeal during this era of acid house remixes. Released under _Wandu_ on **6 July 2007**, available to download from [Traxsource](https://www.traxsource.com/index.php?act=show&fc=tpage&cr=titles&cv=9654). Time _59m 13s 45ms_
13. _Basstoy ft Dana_ - “Running” Now, this isn't your typical One Phat Classic entry. Normally, I pick a track that either has either been re-released or just delve into my archives and pick one of my alltime favourites. This time though, its a dedication. Last month, I received an email from a soldier out in the Emirates, telling me how he runs through the desert listening to the podcast. He went on to say how surreal it is running for 5-6 miles every day, past dead camels, while listening to the latest in funky house. Kudos sir - this one's for you! Released under _Blue Plate_ in 2001, probably available second hand on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/). Time _1h 03m 43s 45ms_
