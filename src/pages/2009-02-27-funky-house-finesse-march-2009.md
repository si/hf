With the [One Phat DJ Podcast](https://www.onephatdj.com/podcast) finally laid to rest after December's "[Encore](https://simonjobling.com/blog/2008/encore/)", it's time to start something a little different.

_Funky House Finesse_ is a new programme of mixes produced by myself, One Phat DJ, with the same intention of promoting the **finest** in funky house music.

Each 90 minute show will highlight the latest funky house music doing the rounds of the club scene, tunes that you may hear from industry leaders like [Hed Kandi](https://www.hedkandi.com/), [Fierce Angels](https://www.thefutureisfierce.com/), [Defected](https://www.defected.com/) and [Ministry of Sound](https://www.ministryofsound.com/) as well as the smaller independent labels, plus **exclusive** white label and bootleg tracks from upcoming producers.

You may be thinking "_This sounds remarkably like the podcast, what's different?_" - well here's the catch...

**Each show will only be available for download for one month!**

At the end of the month, the mix will be taken offline and you won't be able to download it after that. The reason for this is to ensure only the hottest music of the moment is available for download at any one time.

There are also plans to broadcast each show on selected internet radio stations - more details of this will be posted later.

So, without further ado, I present the first in the series of _Funky House Finesse_.

Let me know what you think of the new format by leaving a comment below.Â  All your input is welcomed.

If you're interested in broadcasting the show on your radio station, please email [licensing@onephatdj.com](mailto:licensing@onephatdj.com) with some details**.**

Finally, if you enjoy any of the music featured in the show, **please support the artist by purchasing the track**. All the tunes that can be purchased online are linked to in the track listing so you have no excuse. **Enjoy!**
