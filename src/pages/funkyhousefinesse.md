## The second season of the podcast, establishing a new format for a new era, with a focus on the funky house genre One Phat DJ often celebrated.

The show was now released every 2 weeks on Saturday, now for 2 hours compared the One Phat DJ's "CD friendly" 80 minutes. It had 3 sections;

- **Heart & Soul** - focus on more melodic, soulful house music
- **Love Lounge** - more uplifting house music, typically the warm up for a good dance
- **Disco Tech** - the tougher, techy range of house music, with a hat-tip back to disco roots

The Funky House Finesse season welcomed some new voice over talents with Ben Day providing the show commentary and Anna Sills for our ongoing idents. We invited these professional radio DJs to support us as the podcast was now being syndicated on a variety of radio stations including [Lifted Radio](https://lifted-radio.co.uk/), [Digitally Imported](https://di.fm/), [Where's The Culture](https://wtchouseradio.com/), [House Music Podcasts](https://www.housemusicpodcasts.co.uk) and more.

Funky House Finesse lasted two years until it reached 50 episodes and One Phat DJ decided to take a parental break and introduce a different approach to make the podcast more sustainable as House Finesse.
