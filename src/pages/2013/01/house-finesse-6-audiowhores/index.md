Do we have a stellar show lined up for you this month? After that mammoth 4 hour session from last month, we kick start 2013 with a special guest mix from Graham Lord and Adam Unsworth, aka Audiowhores.

The acclaimed duo have established themselves as key figures in the UK house scene since 2000, producing and remixing some of the biggest tracks from the last 12 years.

But before all that, here is the first hour with your regular hosts, Souljackerz.
