Following in the footsteps of the biggest producers and DJs in the house music industry, House Finesse are honoured to be supported by the guys behind [House Music Podcasts](https://housemusicpodcasts.co.uk/).

Back when the site was originally launched, [One Phat DJ](https://www.onephatdj.com) was invited to be an early feature with his [Funky House Finesse show](https://housemusicpodcasts.co.uk/category/one-phat-dj/) which paved the way for other big name DJs and producers to join the roster. Figures suggest One Phat DJ was one of the most downloaded shows on the network, only pipped by a handful of DJs when Funky House Finesse came to an end in Summer 2012.

Now in it's new guise and joined by co-hosts [Souljackerz](https://www.facebook.com/souljackerz), [House Finesse returns to House Music Podcasts](https://housemusicpodcasts.co.uk/category/house-finesse/) on a brand new channel with our new direction and format.

The entire back catalogue is now available from HMP and we will now be syndicating all new shows from there before anywhere else.

We'd like to take this opportunity to thank Tom Upton and House Music Podcasts for their support and look forward to a wonderful relationship in the future, bringing a regular dose of the finest selection of house every month.

Now, let's make it the most popular show on the network again.
