Week three of our _#ONEPHATDECADE_ anniversary celebrations continues with another massive guest mix from amazing DJ/producer (and fellow Midlander) - **Stuart Ojelay**.

Stu has been regularly featured on the podcast throughout the years with his range of uplifting productions which, I believe, started with a cheeky bootleg of the classic _Solu Music – Fade_. Since then, he's been rattling out tune after tune, many of them signed to Hed Kandi and other big labels though the years.

He's now producing a brand new podcast to promote his very own label [World of Mouth](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/stuart-ojelay-worldwide-hed/id310976834) which we are delighted to showcase to the world (pun intended).

Prepare yourself for an hour of vocal club bangers featuring a couple Stu's very own tunes to get you ready for the weekend and join us on the continued celebrations of _#ONEPHATDECADE_.

Be sure to connect with Stu on the usual channels ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stuartojelay) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/stuartojelay)) for much more of his work and upcoming gigs.

_(Footnote: In anticipation of next week's 50th House Finesse show, we've lined up one of our most influential DJs with a very special guest mix. We are very excited to have this legend on board so get ready for some heavenly treats…)_
