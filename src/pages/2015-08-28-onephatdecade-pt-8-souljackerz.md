As we enter the bank holiday weekend and the 8th week of _#ONEPHATDECADE_, we're treated to an absolute belting classics mix from our very own **Souljackerz**.

Back in 2011 when I was reconsidering the format of the podcast, I was keen to explore new partnerships to share the journey with fellow lovers of fine house music. Over the years, we had featured quite a number of guest DJs and producers, bringing new talent to the table along the way. I wanted to collaborate with someone and there was one particular act I had in mind - enter the Souljackerz.

Souljackerz duo Stuart Braybrooke and Matt Tsang have been working the circuit for many years, bringing their unique flavour of house music to turntables and speakers across the UK and beyond. Inspired by a range of different music genres, they blend the funkiest soul with the deepest jams from house music and beyond. I remember hearing their remix of Adele's "_Rollin' In The Deep_" for the first time and thinking "This is not your typical pop remix - this is pure gold!". They continued to deliver some belting tracks which confirmed for me Souljackerz had skills that would really compliment the podcast.

I met up with Matt for a few drinks, threw around some ideas on how we could evolve the podcast and "_House Finesse_" was born. Fast forward 4 years and here we are, 55 shows under the belt between us and celebrating 10 years of house music through the podcast. It could never have happened without them and I'm eternally grateful for all their help along the way.

To celebrate _#ONEPHATDECADE_, Stu and Matt have put together a very special classics mix featuring MANY influential tunes from their past. This is serious tunage, perfect as we go into the bank holiday weekend. Download, turn it up to 11 and enjoy!
