Last week, we kicked off the _#ONEPHATDECADE_ anniversary season with a two hour mix of soulful classics by your resident One Phat DJ.

As we continue the celebrations, we have arranged some AMAZING guest mixes from friends of the show, people we've met along the journey from the past 10 years who have helped define our style and audience.

This week, we bring back our very first guest DJ on the rebranded _House Finesse_ show, the one and only **Sam Divine** with her fabulous live set from this year's WE ARE FSTVL in London.

Sam is no stranger to the podcast scene, hosting [DEFECTED's official weekly podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/defected-in-the-house/id120107389?mt=2) for the past few years with her excellent selection of house music and her sassy personality.

Get ready for 80 minutes of uplifting house tracks finely curated into a special treat.
