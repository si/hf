**One Phat DJ is back with 12 massive house tunes for the brighter Spring months.**

What do you want us to say? It's right at the end of April which, arguably, is the middle of Spring (even if the British weather certainly isn't reflecting that).

The reality is we've been intending to compile a mix for the past few months but never got around to it. Well, now we have and it's an impressive collection of tunes One Phat DJ has been hammering since Christmas. It's a healthy balance of commercial dance bangers with familiar "indie" house legends to get you fired up. We're loving the Fatboy Slim opener and complementary "hip-house" tracks, especially Icarus' rude but infectious disco vibes (apols for the expletives!)

As always, let us know what you think. We love to hear back from all the listeners, the good and the bad thoughts. Give us a reason to keep delivering these mixes. It's the loyal following that motivates us to produce the podcast, even 12 years on. (On that point, does that make this the longest running house music podcast?)

We've also tried something a little different this time with a Youtube video to complement the audio. Nothing fancy but it extends our reach to another (popular) platform where many people listen to music. Let us know if this works or if you have any suggestions to improve it. We're always looking for help as well so, if you're a video blogger with skillz to share, get in touch.
