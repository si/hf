As we continue our Summer tour of the finest house destinations in the world, Andy Daniels brings us a very special guest mix from his new Foundation night in Manchester, UK.

No stranger to the dance scene, Andy has been DJing all over the world since the very early days with some of the biggest names in the industry.

For the past four years, Andy has also been co-hosting the Triple Dee Radio Show with his partner in crime, David Dunne, producing a wealth of tracks including the recent Changing Planes track and now hosting his very own Foundation nights in his home town of Manchester.

This mix gives you a taste of the "underground sound" you can expect to hear at Foundation Manchester. We don't need to tell you to turn it up.
