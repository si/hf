Four weeks into the #ONEPHATDECADE celebrations and we have yet another fantastic guest mix for you, this time from our Dutch DJ/producer friend, **Jay Santi**.

I remember discovering one of Jay Santi's cheeky bootlegs back in 2010 when David Dunne featured it on a the [Triple Dee Radio Show](https://www.facebook.com/tripledeemusic). Since then, Jay has been producing some of the finest soulful and deep house tracks on the circuit and remixing some of the biggest names.

It's an absolute honour to have him featured in our Summer series of guest mixes. His mix suitably defines his skills and style in house music and how well they align with our _House Finesse_ sound.

Be sure to follow Jay's productions on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JaySanti), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jay_santi) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jaysanti) and check out his back catalogue available on [Traxsource](https://www.traxsource.com/artist/19693/jay-santi) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/jay-santi/id303960499).
