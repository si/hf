Well, another month has flown by and so that means only one thing - it's time for another dose of **One Phat DJ**! Last month was a little quiet on the funky house scene and material was a little scarce for promotion but the artists and labels have got their winter gloves on and started releasing some hot new material for next month's [Miami Winter Music Conference](https://www.wmcon.com/). You might notice a repeat performance from **ATFC and Inaya Day** with their track _'Reach Out To Me'_ but I think you need to hear the original mix to fully appreciate the quality of this track (no offence to Haji & Emmanuel - you guys rock too!) ![Funkin' February cover](https://www.simonjobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/funkin_february_cover_300px.gif) With the new year in full swing too, it's time to introduce a new format to the One Phat DJ podcasts. Not only will I be showcasing some of the biggest tracks released, I will be diving in to my record box and pulling out some oldies for you too. **One Phat Tune** is any tune from the last ten years that I feel is worthy of a replay and **One Phat Classic** is anything from the past that kicks ass and deserves some airplay. Let me know what you think of these and what you would like to hear in the future. Below are the tracklistings of **Funkin' February**, followed by a direct link to download the mix.
