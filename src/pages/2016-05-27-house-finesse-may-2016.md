Following quite a substantial break, One Phat DJ scratches that itch mixing up an hour of his favoruite tracks from the past five months just in time for the bank holiday break.

If you're reading this far, you're one of the few people who actually take the time to get all the detail. Obviously there's been a bit of a hiatus since the Christmas mix (has it been that long?) Unfortunately, other commitments have taken priority over recent years leaving the podcast feeling a bit neglected. One half of the Soul Jackerz has recently become a dad too so his commitments have changed as well. Life is taking over!

That's not to say it's the end of House Finesse. Last year's 10th anniversary highlighted how far and wide we have spread, connecting with thousands of producers, DJs and music fans. We still love our house music and will have the desire to deliver the occasional mix of the finest house tracks. It just won't be as regular.

We've also been shifting our focus to other mainstream music platforms. People are digesting music in a number of different ways now, specifically curating their own playlists. Where do DJ mixes fit in this evolution? Is there still demand for us? We think so but we also appreciate everyone's tastes and habits differ.

You can now [follow House Finesse on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhRURxaNkKS4YytBGqlKEA) where we curate monthly playlists of our favourite tracks from the official sources (where possible).

We're also still curating our [monthly Soundcloud playlists](https://soundcloud.com/housefinesse/sets) too if you're that way inclined (their new [GO subscription](https://soundcloud.com/go) is looking more appealing now, eh?)

In the mean time, grab your copy of this mix, turn it up and enjoy the Summer vibes. It's party season - and we're all over that!
