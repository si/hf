Holiday season is well underway now and, with it, we bring another selection of the finest house cuts from our very own resident, One Phat DJ.

If you haven't already gathered, we're ramping up the frequency of the mixes through the British Summer with monthly hour mixes from regular and guest DJs.

For July, One Phat DJ returns with his favourite cuts from the past few months including some trusted familiar names and hot new artists. As always, he takes us on a journey through disco, soulful, jackin and club house tunes, even some classic recuts have been thrown in this time too!

A special thank you must go out to our friends at [House Music Podcasts](https://www.housemusicpodcasts.co.uk/). We realised this month they've been supporting us with hosting for the past 8 years. Without them, it would've been impossible to sustain our show from the sheer demand for bandwidth. We're forever in debt to those guys and eternally grateful.

Let's get on with the show…!
