So [the last mix](https://www.housefinesse.com/onephatdj/best-served-chilled/) went down like a lead balloon - whether it was due to the dodgy decision to include Liberty X in it, I don't know but I've moved on now and put a new mix together today!

"**Born In October**" is a dedication to all those birthdays in October. It seems, in my family at least, that the majority of birthdays fall in October (coincidentally falling on the 9 month mark from Valentine's day!). I've got a friend's 30th next week (which I am actually DJing at so the mix seemed like an ideal opportunity to have an hour break), an aunt's 40th weekend just gone and my mother-in-law turns 50 in a few weeks time. This is alongside about 5 other birthdays including my wife's which we are going away for.

Anyway, it seemed like an ideal opportunity to get my funky gloves back on and create a new 10-tracker of funky house for all to enjoy, whether its you're birthday or not.
