As mentioned last week in the release of [Winter Warmup](https://www.simonjobling.com/blog/2007/winter-warmup), there are a few Christmas treats lined up for all the One Phat DJ fans. With the intention of giving you all something to listen to as we go into the party season, it seems like an ideal opportunity to venture in to slightly different terrain with some different genres to what I'd normally play. Kicking off this special mini-mix are a set of funky "breaks" numbers. I quote the word breaks as its not strictly breaks but it certainly is verging on the edge of the genre. The Jinks are a fantastic new British act that are showing true diversity in the dance industry, introducing some completely original styles that aren't typically showcased in the market. For all those fans of [With A Twist](https://www.simonjobling.com/blog/2006/with-a-twist), it all goes a little tougher and darker (still with a sense of funk in there). This mix is also a sort of ode to the DJ who inspired me to get in to this industry. With his highly original style to DJing, bringing dance music to the masses along with one of the most successful beach parties in the World, Fatboy Slim is forever in my debt for his contributions to music. As far as I'm concerned, he should be knighted! Ladies and gentleman, I give you _Episode 35_ of the One Phat DJ Podcast. This is **Break From The Norm**. ![Cover for Break From The Norm](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2185/2110880440_18f8ee50e2.jpg "Cover for Break From The Norm")

As always, leave your comments. I'm sure this mix should create a bit of a stir among the regulars so send me your worst. If there are any download issues, I apologise. I am currently toying with the idea of moving all the files over to Amazon's S3 service - at least that is reliable. I just hope it won't be too costly. More on that next week.
