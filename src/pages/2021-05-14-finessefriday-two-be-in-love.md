**Another deep dive into the archives for this weekâ€™s #FinesseFriday with Annette Passley choosing one of her favourites from September 2007, [Two Be In Love](https://www.housefinesse.com/onephatdj/two-be-in-love/).**

As a token gesture for One Phat DJ's first wedding anniversary, there are plenty love-based tracks featured in this set plus some of his wife's all-time favourites from Gadjo and Masters At Work wrapping up the session.

Big thanks to Annette for choosing this one (amongst many of her own favourites) and all her support over the past 15 years. We hope this trip down Memory Lane brings her plenty fond thoughts from through the years.
