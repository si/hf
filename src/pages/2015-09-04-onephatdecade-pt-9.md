Even though Summer is officially over in the UK, that's not going to stop us as I delve back into the archives to select another set of funky house classics from _#ONEPHATDECADE_.

Kids are heading back to school, adults are returning to work (hopefully with a golden glow), the weather is turning – but that shouldn't stop us being so down in the mouth. We've had a monster of a season as we celebrated the past 10 years of house music. Not only have we had some amazing music to enjoy, we've been joined by some of the most influential people along the way.

I have to give a heart-felt thank you to all the guest DJs who have been part of the _#ONEPHATDECADE_ series providing a real ecletic selection of tunes across the broad spectrum that is "funky house": [Sam Divine](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/onephatdecade-pt-2-sam-divine-live-at-we-are-fstvl-2015/), [Stuart Ojelay](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/onephatdecade-pt-3-stuart-ojelay/), [Jay Santi](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/onephatdecade-pt-4-jay-santi/), [Paul Velocity](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/onephatdecade-pt-5-dj-paul-velocity/), [J Paul Getto](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/onephatdecade-pt-6-j-paul-getto-live-milan-italy/), [DJ Cruze](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/onephatdecade-pt-7-dj-cruze/) & [Souljackerz](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/onephatdecade-pt-8-souljackerz/). Without you, none of this would have been possible and just goes to show the undevoted passion we all share for our favourite music genre…

> "Everybody loves house music; it's a spiritual thing, a body thing, a soul thing."

As promised at the start of the series, I've returned with the second part of my personal favourites from the past 10 years. We kickstarted with some soulful disco cuts and now it's time to turn it up a notch with some nu disco, jackin' and deeper house club anthems. I've tried to include as many regular artists and producers featured through the years so hopefully there's something for everyone that takes you back to those good old days.

I don't need to tell you what to do – you should know by now.
