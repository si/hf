### We're back after a Winter break with a brand new extended format to bring some joy through difficult global times.

Following some unexpected demands over the Winter with personal and professional challenges, we've decided to revive the podcast in the face of the global Coronavirus pandemic with a slightly different format.

Rather than the traditional monthly hour-long dose, we're going to bring you **four seasonal 2 hour shows** throughout the year with **Lemon Yellow Pea**, **Gweilo** and **One Phat DJ** taking it turns to go back-to-back.

- **Spring Break üåª** \- typically around Easter when many people are starting travels and parties
- **Summer House üèñ** \- kicking off the Summer holidays around July
- **Halloween üéÉ** \- as the darker nights approach in October
- **New Year** üéÜ - wrapping up the year with a Christmas & New Year party special
