![One Phat DJ presents Sold](/wp-content/sold_sleeve_01.gif) I might be getting a little ahead of myself here but I've created a new mix for November in celebration of us buying our first house. We found out yesterday that the first stage of our mortgage application has gone through and the second stage (surveyance) has been initiated. Considering the house is only ten years old, the chances are good for the bank to lend us the money so the biggest hurdle of the move has been jumped. The estate agents are hoping to complete the sale by 3rd December which doesn't leave us much time. We're quite happy with this as it saves us time waiting around but from talking to friends, it sounds a little ambitious and we do have a lot of packing to do. Saying that, we could be in for Christmas which would be ideal. Here's to hoping... Anyway, if you like your funky house and want to join in with the celebrations, go [download the latest mix "Sold"](https://www.funkyhousetunes.com/mp3/onephatdj/sold.mp3 "Direct download from Funky House Tunes").
