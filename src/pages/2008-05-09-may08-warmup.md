The sun is out, everyone is feeling good so what more reason do you need for a healthy dose of fresh and funky house, all mixed up by your resident DJ? Let's get straight on with it...

## Promotion

With it being [Deaf Awareness Week](https://www.worldwithoutsound.org/), it seems appropriate to highlight the [Don't Lose The Music](https://www.dontlosethemusic.com/) campaign. Being a DJ and huge lover of music in general, I am constantly aware of the dangers of losing my hearing, especially after watching the awesome movie "[It's All Gone Pete Tong](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388139/)" where DJ Frankie Wilde (played by the brilliant Paul Kaye) loses his hearing from over-indulging in the Ibiza lifestyle. The intention of _Don't Lose The Music_ is to raise awareness of playing your music safely, be it in a club atmosphere or on your iPod earphones. One Phat DJ strongly urges you to consider taking care of your ears, as well as bring awareness to those around you. Those of us who can appreciate music should not take it for granted - there are some people who aren't so lucky. Give those people a thought too... [![Donâ€™t Lose The Music banner](images/dont-lose-the-music-banner-500px.png)](https://www.dontlosethemusic.com/) With the serious issues said and done, it's now time to cheer things up again and present to you **Episode 46** of the One Phat DJ Podcast - it's the **May '08 Warm Up**.
