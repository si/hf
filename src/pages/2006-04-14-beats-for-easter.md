I don't think there has ever been so much anticipation just for a One Phat DJ mix ever before but this month seems to have had people from all over the globe asking me when the "April" mix is due. Well, for all those requests out there, I can now put you all at ease. I present to you the 12th installment of One Phat DJ's podcast - **Beats For Easter**.

It's been a mixed bag of tracks released this month. Several interesting new releases that you will find in this month's mix include a cover of a track that Shola Ama certainly made famous back in 2000 "Sweetest Taboo" as well as Alex Party's "Don't Give Me Your Life". There's also the re-release of last year's dance anthem "Most Precious Love" which has got some funky treatment from those UK producers **Freemasons**. Something else you might notice in this month's mix are some awesome soundbites that I've been generously donated. Those sexy "_One Phat ..._" bites are compliments of **Clare Ewing** - fi√°nce of my DJ friend from Manchester, [DJ Cruze](https://www.djcruze.co.uk/) (who also podcasts his favourite funky house tunes _weekly_). Big thanks to you guys for your help and all the best for the wedding this Summer.
