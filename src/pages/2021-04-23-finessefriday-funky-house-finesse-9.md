**For this week's #FinesseFriday, Al Mayers has selected one of his all-time favourite mixes from Summer 2009.**

Al has followed the podcast from the early days and always supported us on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HouseFinesse/) with endless messages and reactions of encouragement. This week, we asked him to pick a mix for **#FinesseFriday** which was apparently a tricky but enjoyable decision to make when he chose [Funky House Finesse 9 from 1 August 2009](https://www.housefinesse.com/onephatdj/funky-house-finesse-9/).

We hope you enjoy this Summery revival as much as we do. (Great to hear Ben Day's radio voice again too - there's a blast from the past too!)
