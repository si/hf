It had to be done. There were some belting tracks last year and I had to get my personal favourite "Lola's Theme" into a mix sooner or later. I had a tight deadline to get this done for a leaving party so excuse any messy mixing. There are some not-so-sweet mixes in there at points but it was the track selection I was after in this mix.

1. Danny Howells - Dusk Till Dawn (Shapeshifters Vox Mix)
2. Michael Gray - The Weekend (Extended Vocal Mix)
3. Uniting Nations - Out Of Touch (Extended Mix)
4. Narcotic Thrust - I Like It (Vocal Tribal Mix)
5. Eric Prydz - Call On Me (Retarded Funk Calling Mix)
6. Armand Van Helden - My My My (Ashley Beedle Mix)
7. Mousse T ft Emma Lanford - Is It Cos I'm Cool (So Phat Remix)
8. Stonebridge - Put 'Em High (JJ 12'' Mix)
9. Soul Central feat Kathy Brown - Strings Of Life (Stronger On My Own)
10. Shapeshifters - Lola's Theme (Extended Vocal Mix)
