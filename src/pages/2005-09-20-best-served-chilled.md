The last mix I created wasn't my best piece of work. "Last Year" was put together within a couple of hours for a leaving party and consisted of some of (what I thought) last year's best dance tracks released. Some of the mixing was slightly out and the versions of the tracks I used weren't my favourite. By the by, it has been downloaded a fair few times on Global Beatz and some of my mates have requested copies on CD.

Today, I've finished putting together a new mix of tracks I'm _feeling_ this month. They all seem to be taking quite a relaxed approach to funky house so it seemed only apt to call the mix "_Best Served Chilled_".

Some of the artists appearing on the mix, amongst others, include **Ian Carey**, **Jamiroquai**, **Soul Avengerz**, **Phats & Small** and (some might cringe) **Liberty X**. Before you start thinking "Si, you've lost it!! Liberty X?? What are you doing??", check it out first. It might just be me but I find the remix works quite nicely and has a funky sound to it. The full tracklisting is below.

1. 2 Vibes - Found You (Club Mix)
2. Fallen Angels - City Life (Herd & Fitz Mix)
3. Freefunkt - Moment Of My Life (Original Mix)
4. Ian Carey - Nonstop (Main Mix)
5. House Groovers - Saved By The Music (Sstm Extended Mix)
6. Jamiroquai - Seven Days In Sunny June (Oliver Lang Remix)
7. Lisha Project - Feel (Miguel Migs Petalpusher Vocal Mix)
8. Liberty X - Song 4 Lovers (Soularis 12inch Club Mix)
9. Phats & Small - Its A Beautiful Day (Vocal Mix)
10. Soul Avengerz - Love Dancin' (B1 Mix)
