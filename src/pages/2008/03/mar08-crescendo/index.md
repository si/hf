It's the latter part of the month, we've had [The Warm Up](https://www.simonjobling.com/blog/2008/mar08-the-warm-up), so it can only mean one thing... it's time for a **Crescendo** mix! Among the favourites this month are some great remixes of classic house tunes, some from the early noughties (Paul Johnson's "_Get Get Down_"), some even from the mid nineties (Liquid's "_Sweet Harmony_")! We also have an exclusive _Bassmonkeys_ remix of Jocelyn Brown's new project in The AllStar Collective's awesome "_All About The Music_", a tune I've not stopped playing for the last month, as well as plenty more chuggy basslines, snappy beats and uplifting vocals to get you in a lather.

With this being one of his first commissions in the last few years, he has surpassed himself with this grungy little number, after throwing ink all over his floor for that dirty splatter effect. I'm really chuffed with this final piece and I doubt this is the last time you'll be seeing our "nocturnal monkey" on the [One Phat DJ Podcast](https://onephatdj.com/podcast).
