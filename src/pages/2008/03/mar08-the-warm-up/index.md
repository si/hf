As we move out of those cold Winter months and into an (apparently) warmer Spring, focus shifts towards thoughts of bright and sunny holidays, parties, happy people - generally, all things positive. By painting that picture, you should be set for what is coming up this month - the Miami Winter Music Conference - the biggest event of the year in the dance music industry. DJs, producers, artists, promoters, labels and clubbers travel from far and wide to celebrate this landmark event where some of the finest figures in the industry collate to share their latest work, network, make the most of the opportunity to showcase what to expect for the rest of the year and have an amazing time in the process. It seems only appropriate to celebrate the landmark occasion with the first mix of March 2008 - here is _Episode 42_, “**Mar '08 - The Warm Up**”.

Supplying the artwork this week is Mr [Cole Henley](https://cole007.net/), hailing all the way from bonnie Scotland. I love this clever cross reference with Miami in such a relevant month - the simplicity of the silhouettes keep the image pure and simple, the graphic equalisers subtly making appropriate suggestions.

With that, all that is left to do is download the mix, turn up the speakers (or your headphones) and feel the warmth ooze into your body from the uplifting soulful sounds. You'll be in Miami before you know it!
