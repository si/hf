In the third and final installment of One Phat DJ's "_Best Of 2007_" series, we venture into the tougher side of funky house and get you all psyched for a good dance. In 2007, the dirty bassline was very prominent in the dance scene so there was plenty of material to get your knickers in a twist, getting the dancef loors really sweaty while the music verged on hard house. Needless to say, the majority of that material will have made it into this mix so its time to loosen up before I take you on your last journey of 2007. This is _Episode 39_ of the One Phat DJ podcast - this is the "_Best Of 2007, Part 3 - **Euphoria**_".

### Description

I've long been a fan of _The Shapeshifters_, ever since the massive 2003 hit "_Lola's Theme_". However, most comebacks in the dance scene are either non-existent or really poor. Thankfully, the Shapeshifters broke the mould and managed to make a great return with some banging tunes, one of my favourites being "_New Day_". Now that we've set the scene, its time for another great track from early in the year with _De Souza_'s lush cover of "_Guilty_", this time with an added twist thanks to _Bimbo Jones_. Time to inject a bit of a Latin feel into the mix now compliments of _Sergio Flores_ and the Japanese producer _Mitomi Tokoto_ and their infectious rumblings in "_Hold On (That Piano Track)_". More Latin inspired sounds follow with the German producer _Raul Rincon_ and vocalist _Carolina Escolano_ throwing their collaboration into the mix with "_Mi Amor_", a truly uplifting and catchy tune which Hed Kandi proudly featured in their Disco Heaven compilation. We then venture into commercial terrain with two massive hits from late Summer, starting off with _Armand Van Helden_'s anthem "_NYC Beat_", shortly followed by _Fedde Le Grand_'s reworking of _Ida Corr_'s "_Let Me Think About It_", my favourite tune from the entire year. I really can't put my finger on what makes the track so perfect but it certainly got bums shaking around the country when it went straight into Number 1 of the UK Charts. We then return back to start of the year with the first track that got my attention in 2007 - the synth happy, lyrically blessed "_Need You Tonight_" from the _Kingpinz_ and _Antonio Lucas_. _Henrik B_'s reworking of the dance classic "_Soul Heaven_" had to get into the mix somewhere and this is swiftly followed up with Radio 1's latest signing _Dave Spoon_ and his track "_Won't Do It Again (Sunrise)_". It wasn't long before there would be commercial successes, this time from Ministry's Data Records. _Alex Gaudino_'s saxophone-induced "_Destination Calabria_" was a monster track through the summer months, as was _Dada_'s filthy tune "_Lollipop_". Kudos goes to _Sandy Rivera_ for getting away with making this innuendo heavy track one of the most catchiest tunes of 2007. Yet another Data record follows with yet another saucy video, this time in the form of _Mason_ and _Princess Superstar_ with their huge hit "_Exceeder (Perfection)_". To wrap up the whole mix (and series), what better way than to get a dirty funked up remix of _Robyn_'s Summer anthem "With Every Heartbeat" for you all to sing along to? Yeah, its missing those amazing string breakdowns but we need something to fit into the mix and I think this version does perfect.

Let me know what you think of the mix and the whole Best Of 2007 series - you can either post something on the blog below, on the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4894384789) or on [the iTunes listing](https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=98656761). It's entirely up to you. I just hope you've enjoyed it. It's been fun (if a little demanding) but I sure hope it was worthwhile. General feedback has been really good so far so I must be doing something right. So with Part 3 all done and dusted, its time to pack up 2007 and move on to 2008. The next podcast will return to the normal format, showcasing the latest releases in funky house, some exclusives, some you may have already heard, most of them available for you to buy online. I may change the regular release date as well - more information on that later when I make some decisions. Here's to a funky 2008!
