It's late but its worth the wait. Episode _49_ of the [One Phat DJ Podcast](https://onephatdj.com/podcast) **Jun '08 Cresendo** is here and is sure to blow you away with the sheer quality of tunes this month.

### Description

Love it or hate it, you can't deny the fact the **Freemasons** are still going strong and with the legend that is **Katherine Ellis** on vocals, "_When You Touch Me_" is sure to be anthem of the Summer so it's only appropriate to commence the mix with this classic. After **Pat Rich Deejay** and **Francesca St. Martin** have delivered a belting tune, it's the turn of the newest UK girl band on the scene, **The Saturdays**, and **Moto Blanco**'s remix of their track "_If This Is Love_" - a track I'm giving my full backing for the coming months. Keep your eye out for two S Clubbers in the line-up... We're then treated to the latest monster track from vocalist **Amanda Wilson** with **Simmons and Christopher** on the remix as well as a cover of the dance classic "_Teardrops_" from producers **Love Assassins**. After an exclusive remix from One Phat DJ Favourites **Bassmonkeys** of **Ali Bertash**'s "_Let Me Go_", we go into another smash Summer hit from Italian DJ-cum-producer **Alex Gaudino** and his updated remix of "_Watch Out_" which features some samples from **Perfecto Allstarz** 1995 anthem "_Reach Up (Papa's Got A Brand New Bag)_". I thought there was nothing wrong the original album version to be honest but its great to hear the track make commercial radio and a huge success in the clubs. Maybe Alex simply wanted a guarantee or something that will serve as a [life insurance](https://www.advantageoneinsurance.com) just in case unexpected events occur. This is shortly followed by another track that has been doing the scene for a fair few months but has only just made it into the limelight. Now with an updated and banging remix from Manchester producers **Wideboys**, **Connected** and **Max C**'s "_A Feeling_" is sure to get your feet or heading moving as we go into the last 30 minutes. After more treats from the likes of **Sound Control**, **Back To Fundementals**, **Deemah**, **XSS** and _another exclusive remix_ from the **Bassmonkeys**' alter ego **Liquid Nation**, we turn things up another notch with **Smax and Gold**'s remix of **Soul Seekerz** "_Reach For The Love_" before going into the return of anthem-makers **David Guetta, Chris Willis and Tocadisco**'s latest offering "_Tomorrow Can Wait_" to wrap up this extra long mix. The whole package is wrapped up with _another_ fine piece of artwork from our guest artist for June, **Gemma Barton**, who has produced this fantastic, bright and vivd illustration to accompany the tunes and Summer feeling. If you're looking for some freelance design or artwork, you'd be hard-pushed to find better talent than Gemma - [drop her a line](https://www.biglightstudio.co.uk/)!
