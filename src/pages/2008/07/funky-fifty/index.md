After **three years of podcasting** and **49 episodes** of the freshest and funkiest house music mixed up (bi-)monthly, we've finally hit the milestone. **Episode 50** is here! [![Funky Fifty, mixed by One Phat DJ, designed by Sam Hardacre](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2311/2658445134_7d5804f913.jpg?v=0 "Funky Fifty, mixed by One Phat DJ, designed by Sam Hardacre")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/peelhere/2658445134/) It's quite an emotional moment for myself and, I'm sure, all the other guys involved. I never expected the podcast to be as successful as it has been, nor the respect it receives from the fans and industry. From far and wide, people from all over the globe are subscribed to the podcast and, without you, it wouldn't be what it is today. I'm constantly sent messages from regular listeners which motivates me further to keep doing the podcast. I thank you all. Now the speech is out the way, I have a few announcements to make about the podcast, by way of changing the format (again):

- After a six month trial, I've decided to return to producing the podcast **just once a month**.Â  There are several reasons behind this decision but, for you guys, it just means **quality will come over quantity**.
- Rather than limiting the mix to 80 minutes in total (originally for those who like to burn a CD copy for the car), I shall be **extending the mix** to a whopping **2 hour special**. More time, more tunes!
- To keep all those CD fans happy, you will also be able to download an **80 minute edited version** directly from the website **with a CUE file** for easy skipping.
- It's time to scrap the formal naming conventions for the podcast too. House music is an art form. It's about being creative. Let's go back to the catchy names, starting with this one.

There are a few other ideas I am currently toying with so keep checking back for details. I know there will be disappointed listeners out there but that is life. You can't please everyone. With that out the way, let's pick things up again and get listening to **the latest in funky, soulful, disco and electro house**. There are **23 tracks** in this month's mix so there is bound to be something for everyone. Don't forget - if you like the tune, go buy it! There are links to legal downloads for all the tracks below and for as little as just **99p** - what's your excuse? Here it is - **Funky Fifty**.
