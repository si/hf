There are some people who are put on this earth solely to entertain. There are some people who have such beautiful voices, it would be a crime if they were not given the opportunity to showcase their ability to the public. There are some people who have both these qualities yet still don't have the full exposure they truly deserve. So I have taken it upon myself to deliver one of my favourite artists in all their glory through the magic of mixing. **Presenting... Bonnie Bailey**.

I discovered Ms Bailey several years back on an old [Hed Kandi](https://www.hedkandi.com/) release. I was playing a CD to a few friends while we were chilling out when we heard a track that just had us hooked. After several repeat plays back to enjoy the musical treats a few times, it became a firm favourite in our clique. Years have passed by with many more musical treats getting the Bonnie Bailey treatment, often teaming up with the likes of Eric Kupper and other quality music producers to give tracks her unique sound.

It dawned on me the other month that there was still no official album release from Bonnie. There was stipulation last year of a new release during the early part of 2007 but obviously that time has passed. On [her official blog](https://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendID=76512807&MyToken=4c9fa9dc-60a3-4ab2-8057-ed147c05afb3ML) (unfortunately via [MySpace](https://www.myspace.com/theofficialbonniebailey)), she's been hinting towards more activity in the studio so there is definitely an album in progress, thankfully backed by One Phat DJ favourites, [Fierce Angels](https://www.fierceangels.com/).

Until then though, you will have to enjoy some of my favourites (mostly from Fierce Angels compilations) in this **exclusive promotional** **Bonnie Bailey** **mini mix**.

This isn't the April podcast by the way - that will be with you by the end of the month **as well**. This is just something to whet your taste buds and to put one of my favourite artists under the spot light for once.

If you've got a lot of love for Bonnie, go and add her to your MySpace friends and leave her a message. I'll make an announcement when her album is released to make sure you all go buy her stuff. But until then, download this mix, turn it up and enjoy the Summer sounds.
