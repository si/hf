Before you get all excited that we're back, we're not. Not regularly anyway.

I recently put together a short (80 minute) mix for a party and thought it only fair to share with the regular listeners of the show. The majority of the tunes are on a _Heart & Soul_ tip with a slight tiptoe into _Love Lounge_ territory so don't expect a full on clubbing session with this mix, just something to whet your appetite.

We're still taking a breather and working out how to make the comeback a bit more special. We're planning to be back in time for Christmas though so you've got some new music to enjoy during the party season.

Let us know if you have any ideas for the comeback too. We want to make sure it's what the listeners want and enjoy. Do you want more guest mixes, more interviews, any other features, or just stick to the familiar pattern?

Get in touch, either in the comments below, on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/onephatdj) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onephatdj), or even email us (_podcast \[at\] onephatdj \[dot\] co \[dot\] uk_). We answer all your emails!
