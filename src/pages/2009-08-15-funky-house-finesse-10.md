We're already half way through August - where has that time gone? Well, don't let it dampen your spirits as _Funky House Finesse_ for the **second of three** doses this month, bringing you a stonking collection of **funky house** delights yet again, all mixed up by One Phat DJ and presented by **Ben Day** for two hours of sexy grooves to prepare you for another Saturday night. Among this week's selection are a few familiar faces such as our favourite **Joey Negro**'s **Sunburst Band**, **Dimitri From Paris**, **Soul Avengerz**, **Susu Bobien**, **Mark Pichiotti** and **Alec Sun Drae**, plus a load of other sexy new tracks from some of our favourite labels like **Purple Music**, **King Street**, **Peppermint Jam** and **Blueplate Global**. We've also take on a slightly different approach with _Disco Tech_ this week, introducing some **jackin' house** tracks that have been lying around One Phat DJ's box for a few months. Let us know what you think and whether you'd like to hear more like this. This month, we also extend our reach by joining [House Music Podcasts](https://www.housemusicpodcasts.co.uk) - another emerging broadcast network setup by the brains behind Lifted Radio, Mark Masters and Tom Upton. At present, this is just a podcast service of hand-picked DJs but they are planning a whole load of new services including a streaming radio system. Check it out and subscribe. Don't forget we've now got a dedicated hotline for your messages and shout outs. It was pretty quiet last month so make sure you give us a call and leave a message, tell us what party plans you have, maybe make some requests - it's up to you. Call **0121 288 3101** now! Finally, we're planning on highlighting the **last six months** in the next _Funky House Finesse_ show, selecting some of our favourite tracks from previous shows. [Let us know what tracks stick out for you](https://www.onephatdj.com/archive/2009/08/funky-house-finesse-10/#respond) and we'll be sure to get them in there. **Enjoy the show!** ![Funky House Finesse 10 - 15th August 2009](https://www.onephatdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Funky_House_Finesse_10_15th_August_2009.jpg "Funky House Finesse 10 - 15th August 2009") \[audio:finesse/Funky\_House\_Finesse\_with\_One\_Phat\_DJ\_10\_15th\_August\_2009.mp3\]
