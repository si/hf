Let's break in August 2009 with a monster of a mix, devoting the majority of the show to something a little more upbeat ready for the Summer. It's **Funky House Finesse 9**. [![](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2531/3774894676_ee5a7bd8f9.jpg "Funky House Finesse 9 artwork")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/peelhere/3774894676/) We've got a great selection of tunes from the likes of **Joey Negro**, **Soraya Vivian**, **Moony**, **Loose Change**, **Sandy Rivera**, **Armand Van Helden**, **Milk & Sugar** plus a bit of a cheeky treat at the end of the show. This week, we welcome a _sassy_ new voice to the team in the form of **Anna Sills**. The lovely lady has come up trumps with some fantastic idents for the show which you can't really miss. I think you'll agree she sounds like a fun lady and adds that special touch to the show. We've also setup a **dedicated phone line** to receive your **requests** and **shout outs**. If you want to be featured on any future shows, simply call **0121 288 3101** and leave a message. We'll be sure to play it in the next scheduled show. There are some exciting plans for the _Funky House Finesse_ show in the pipelines too. It looks like we'll be joining another broadcast service in the near future so keep your ears and eyes open for that. All that's left to say is to download the show, turn it up loud and enjoy. Surely it's a given. \[audio:finesse/Funky\_House\_Finesse\_with\_One\_Phat\_DJ\_1st\_August\_2009.mp3\]
