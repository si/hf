**The Reflex** has been remastering some absolute classics recently which didn't go unnoticed so OPDJ picks out his favourite trio for the first 15 minutes before continuing with his typical selection of soulful, funky, disco vibes followed by a number of club belters.

We also want to take this opportunity to tease you with some plans for this Summer as we approach the **10th anniversary of the podcast**. There will be special guest mixes, classic mixes looking back over the years and even some prizes up for grabs.

We need your help though! We want you to celebrate with us wherever you are in the world. Host House Finesse parties, delve into the archives, send us photos, videos and updates of how you're celebrating.

Get involved on Facebook, Twitter and Soundcloud by simply using hashtag **#finesse10** and we'll share them out to the world.
