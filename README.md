After nearly 20 years of using Wordpress, House Finesse podcast is now being generated with a modern static stack for a faster, reliable experience. 
Focus is on speed, simplicity and consistent branding, clearing out unused sections from the previous version. 
People only use the website for track listings with the rich experience on native podcast apps.
Having full control of the RSS feed should also enable the latest Podcasting 2.0 namespace features.
