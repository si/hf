# House Finesse on 11ty Netlify

*An Unstyled production for the longest running house music podcast, established in 2005 by Si Jobling.*


After nearly 20 years of using Wordpress, House Finesse podcast is now being generated with a modern static stack for a faster, reliable experience. 
Focus is on speed, simplicity and consistent branding, clearing out unused sections from the previous version. 
People only use the website for track listings with the rich experience on native podcast apps.
Having full control of the RSS feed should also enable the latest Podcasting 2.0 namespace features. 

## Todo

- [ ] Roll custom RSS feed with extra Podcasting 2.0 tags
